             <p style="text-align:left;">I am a (rather incompetent) coder, and I do Python, some HTML and JS. In fact this website is one of my projects! I enjoy making games, playing games, music, learning, and running. I'm a really goofy person which should also be noted. My discord username is _scrafty, and text me any time you'd like, and I'll respond as soon as possible. But don't send me any scam DMs pretty please. I am Singaporean/Canadian, and I speak English, Mandarin and am learning French. I enjoy listening to about everything that isn't pop music, which ranges from jazz to EDM to metal. Yes, I'm also a band nerd, I love these kind of things. :/ I live in Canada, time zone GMT-8, and am still in high school. I tend to create a bunch of stupid projects, and they all end up really funny. For all the things I do, I'm usually a one man army in all the thingss I do, and I don't enjoy doing group projects. If you would like to collabarate though, just drop me a text!</p>
